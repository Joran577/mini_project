This will also return the information of the given line passed through the url.

Furthermore, the app allows the extracting of mario kart stats. The method created allows the ability to obtain the characters speed, based on the character name passed through the url.

Furthermore, the statistics for the mario kart racers were downloaded from Kaggle in a CSV file. The file contains characters speed stats, type stats, handling stats, and so on.
